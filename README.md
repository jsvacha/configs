### My Config Files

Repo is laid out as if project directory is my home directory.

From tmux, have to do `leader + I` to install the plugins.
Need to also install a Nerd Font and set your terminal to use that
by default. Chose JetBrainsMono, which can be found on nerdfonts.com.

Must install luarocks package (can use apt).
